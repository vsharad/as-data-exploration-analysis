# Beginning Data Exploration and Analysis with Apache Spark by Swetha Kolalapudi

Description - 

Data preparation is a staple task for any data professional, whether you just want to explore data or develop sophisticated Machine Learning models. Spark is an engine that helps do this in a very intuitive way, using functional constructs that abstract the user from all the messiness of working with large datasets. In this course, Beginning Data Exploration and Analysis with Apache Spark, you'll go through exploratory data analysis and data munging with Spark, step-by-step. First, you'll explore RDDs and functional constructs that make processing in Spark extremely intuitive. Next, you'll discover how to transform and clean unstructured data. Finally, you'll learn how to summarize data along dimensions and how to model relationships to build co-occurrence networks. By the end of this course, you'll be able to use Spark to transform data in any way that you would like.
